==========
This project is an attempt to create a smart program that recurses through scraped data from the jobs(fulltime/internship) section of craiglist. Craiglist is scrapped using the open source project http://scrapy.org/ which is a rapid web crawler built in python. Once we scrap data using scrappy our program goes through the data noting down the email address, keywords from each job oppurtunity and thus 'smartly' editing the cover letter and resume as per the requirement through the keywords . It then automates the process of applying to the jobs by sending emails to the respective email id's with that cover letter, resume through a mailing service. The program is written in Java.
